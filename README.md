# Virtual-Farming-Game
Overview:
The Farm Management System is a simulation game that allows a player to manage a farm, including adding animals, tools, and interacting with various farm entities. This system utilizes several object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, interfaces, method overriding, operator overloading, and more.

The game lets the player manage different types of animals (cow, chicken, sheep), track inventory, and perform tasks like harvesting and combining tools.

Features:
Player Management: A player can manage a farm, add animals, tools, and farm entities.
Animal Production: Each animal (Cow, Chicken, Sheep) can produce different goods.
Tool Inventory: Tools can be added to the player's inventory, with limits.
Static Fields and Methods: Track the total number of animals across the entire game.
Operator Overloading: The player can combine tools using the overloaded + operator.
Inheritance and Interfaces: Animal entities inherit from a base class and implement the IProduce interface.
